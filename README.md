## Getting & Cleaning Data Final Project

The goal of the project is to tidy up a large data file that was obtained by collection accelerometer data from a smartphone.

This repository contains the two main files: data_analysis.R and CodeBook.md

The data_analysis.R code does the following: 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only those measurements that contain the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Generates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The CodeBook.md contains the following:
* A description of the raw data
* Description of the variables
* Explanations on any transformations applied to the data
* Any other work that was performed to clean up the data
